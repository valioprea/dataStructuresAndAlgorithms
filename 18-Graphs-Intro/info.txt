Graph
= nonlinear aggregation of nodes and edges
= popular way to describe networks

Node = vertex, may contain a piece of data
Edge = connection between two nodes


Graphs can be undirected / directed.

Undirected graphs (ex: facebook connection with friends)

If two nodes are connected => adjacency

Dir graphs = one direction! (ex. street maps)
=================================================

DIRECTED GRAPH:
How can we describe a graph ?
- adjacency matrix ( runtime complexity O(1) but space complexity O(n^2)=25 spaces ) - tends to suit graphs that have many edges
OR (
- adjacency list (array list of linked lists) (time complexity O(n), space complexity O(n+E) where E = number of edges)
