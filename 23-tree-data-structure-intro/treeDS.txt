Tree = non linear DS where nodes are organized in a hierarchy
	ex: file explorer, DBs, DNS, HTML DOM

Root node = top of the tree. No incoming edges, only outgoing (Parent)
Leaf node = bottom of the tree. Only incoming edges, no outgoing (Child)
Branch node = in the middle. Have both incoming and outgoing edges (Parent + child)

Any two children that share the same parent, are called siblings.

Subtree = smaller tree, held within a tree

Tree size = # of nodes
Depth of a node = # of edges below the root node. Root node has depth of 0.
Height of a node = # of edges above furthest leaf node
