Big O notation.

''How code slows as data grows".

1. Describes the performance of an algorithm as the amount of data increases
2. Machine independent ( # of steps to completion)
3. Ignore smaller operations O(n+1) -> O (n)

==================================================
Let n = amount of data
 examples: O(1), O(n), O(log n); O(n^2)
